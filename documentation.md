## User Authentication & authorization

- JWT tokens is used for user authentication and authorization.
- JWT token life time in set to 12 hours, modifie it in auth.controller.js at "expiresIn:".
- An email (format: foo@bar.com) and a password (without restriction) are needed.

## Rate Limiting

- Users have five attempts per fifteen-minute period to connect. 
- You can change this in authLimiter.js.

## Endpoints

List and describe each API endpoint. Include the following information for each endpoint:

# For users: 
- get("/") = homepage
- to register: (post) /api/auth/signup
Email and password are needed.
JWT token and ID are provided when user register
- to sign in: (post) /api/auth/signin
Email and password are needed.
JWT token and ID are provided when user logs in.


# To create a contact: 
- (post) '/create':
- The route  is accessed by sending a POST request to the "/create" endpoint. Only authenticated users with a valid JWT token can access it
- Then, the route extract the data from the request body and get the user ID from the 'req.userId' property set by the middleware. 
'contactData' object is created and pushed to the database.
The data is stored under the 'contact/' path followed by the user's ID. 

So one user can create his own list only. 

# To retrieve contacts: 
- (get) '/read':
- The route is accessed by sending a "get" request to the '/read' endpoint. 
- When the route is accessed, it gets the user'sID from the req.userID property set by the middleware. 
- Then, the route use the database to retrieve the data from the database by calling the once() method on a reference to the 'contact/' path followed by the user's ID. 
So the user can only read his own contacts. 

# Test:
    - (get) ("/api/test/user") with an x-access-token

# Get one user 
And retrive his ID, email, hashed password and the dates of creation and update: 
    - by ID: 
(get) "/api/user/:userId" with an x-access-token
    - by email: 
(get) "/api/user/email/:email" with an x-access-token
